# recommender_system
This project is a machine learning-based recommender system built with FastAPI and Scikit-Learn to match users with projects based on their skills. It uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to calculate recommendations. The backend connects to a MySQL database and serves predictions via a FastAPI REST API.
